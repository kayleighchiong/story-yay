# The haunted school :O

## *Introduction*

Hi, I'm Mirah. I'm a Year 1 student entering secondary school for the first time ! I'm really excited as Apple High School is one of the most well known secondary school in Singapore, with good education and learning environment ! I'm also really excited to meet new friends amd learn more new subjects. 

## *Orientation*

On the night before orientation, I could not sleep as I was beyond excited to enter the school the next day and become part of their 'family'.   *Ring...* My alarm rang at 6am sharp and I jumped out of bed. I quickly took a shower, brushed my teeth and ate some breakfast. I put on my uniform and my school tie, picking up my drawstring bag with my pencil case, water bottle and PE attire. I looked in the mirror, adjusted my tie proudly and left the house to take the bus to school. In school, we had a school tour, played some games and interacted with our teachers. "Students, don't forget that we will be having a two-day camp starting from 9pm tonight, so don't be late! See you guys later!" Our form teacher, Mdm Chang reminded us. Oh yeah, there is a camp! I'm defintely looking forward to it!
